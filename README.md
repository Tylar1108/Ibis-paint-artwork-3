I did this artwork with a basic idea of a cyborg, 
at first it was gona be a normal girl but then i watched a movie ||terminator|| (idk if reffering to movies is allowed here but this isnt an advertisement)
then i thought why not try making a robot!? 
the idea of robots have feelings is tried to be conveyed here, hope you like it!
